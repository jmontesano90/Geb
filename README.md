Geb is a transect generator aimed at ecologists, biologists, entomologists or anyone that uses transect based sampling! Use Geb to specify template dimensions, then allow it to tell you where to sample using complete random transect generation. Geb will remember when you sampled and where you sampled in case you need it for your records.
